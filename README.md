There are two modules in ARGs-OAP v2.0. One is for alignment of reads against SARG v2.0 database through first-stage UBLAST and second-stage BLAST to identify and quantify ARGs. The second modules is based on Sargfam, a set of profile Hidden Markov Models of ARGs, to annotate ARGs-like protein sequences (eg. ORFs).
